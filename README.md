# Gemini API Python Integration

This project demonstrates how to interact with the Gemini API using Python. It leverages the `google-generativeai` package to perform various operations. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to install the necessary dependencies, import required packages, and perform API calls.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install google-generativeai
```

## Usage

1. Install the required packages as shown above.
2. Import the necessary libraries and set up the environment.
3. Use the `google.generativeai` package to interact with the Gemini API.

Example of importing packages:

```python
import google.generativeai as genai
```

The notebook includes further steps to perform tasks such as generating text and working with the API responses.
